Growth over year, especially the last 4-6 months
While we were waiting for another project to land, good to see you focus on training and ramping up on two other client support agreements.
You've taken constructive feedback and applied it, great to see.
Great work on that SEO presentation and learning Lighthouse. This could easily be something that you could work on across all of our customers.
Written communication has improved a lot over the last year
You've shown some really good ability to learn and teach others - Take2, SEO and more.
With the new client solution, it's your chance to step up on all things Kentico, and I've noticed the attitude change and it's great to see your focus on it.
With one of our clients you've done a great job getting familiar and hands on with deployment pipelines
For the technical client request, you gave some great consultation to the customer - helping them do this using best practices.
