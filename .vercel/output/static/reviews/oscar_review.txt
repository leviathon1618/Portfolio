I have observed that Levi has improved this year. This just shows his huge potential to become a very significant contributor in the future. 
He has an improved demonstration of eagerness to learn Umbraco Cloud and own the expertise on this platform.
In Kentico related support assignments, he has become more confident in analyzing issues, identifying root causes and proposing effective solutions.
