Working alongside Levi on the big project Sitecore implementation last year was a nice experience. It was impressive to see how quickly Levi levelled up on Sitecore SXA, CSS, JS / FE side of things - enabling him to independently deliver components efficiently.
Levi's increased involvement in new client projects, where he has demonstrated the ability to work independently, showcases his good understanding of these implementations and his capability to take on significant responsibilities.
With Oscar's departure, I'm particularly looking forward - seeing Levi step up. I'm confident in his ability to build upon the skills he developed last year and take the lead on tasks that Oscar previously managed, such as his Kentico skills and Umbraco implementations, among others.
