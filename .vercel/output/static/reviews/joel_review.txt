Have seen some great growth in both hard skill and soft skills. Getting much better in clear communications both verbally and via email. 
Great start into putting your hand up to pick up tasks.
Taking an active role in our client's stand ups, I see a good working relationship has been created here between yourself and the client team.
Giving ideas in team discussions. Not just leaving it for seniors to suggest, it has been a great way to demonstrate your involvement in the team and interest to help the team develop.
Taking on feedback and applying it has been great.
